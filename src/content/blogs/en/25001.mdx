Hello, I'm Sherwin, my Chinese name is习武，
On some social platforms, I often use "希嘉嘉", which sounds like "c++" haha.

## Art

In 2012, I started learning art, following the teacher in the art studio to draw apples,
learning various techniques of light, perspective, sketching, etc.

I remember vividly that once the teacher taught us to draw portraits, I often skipped class, only drawing one,
a week later, I came back to class, my neighbor had already drawn dozens of portraits,
and I scored 130 while he scored 120.
I realized that effort is important, but effort on things with talent is even more important.

Unfortunately, I didn't participate in the art exam, my parents thought painting was just a hobby.
But it's not a big deal, you learn anything eventually won't be in vain...

## Product

My major in university is "fashion design", but I have been working in the internet product field since graduation.
From 2017 to now, it has been 8 years, and I think my understanding ability is exceptional, often one word I know two or three.
I have worked on education, e-commerce, finance, and other projects.

When I was in an execution role, I only used these three axes (concept -> scope -> function) to handle 80% of the situations.
Due to certain strategic goals, it's necessary to define which scope can achieve this goal, and then express the functional combination through prototype language.
It sounds quite simple, perhaps I will explain it slowly later, but you can also read the book "The Elements of User Experience".

My product career gave me more vitality. I remember playing games with classmates in middle school, I was just hitting randomly without any strategy.
After playing more, I realized that skills need to be combined into combos before releasing. Gradually, I came to understand: everything in this world has patterns to follow.
Then, it can be inferred: as long as the method is appropriate, anything you want is possible to achieve.

## Programming

In late 2019, the pandemic started. It was better to learn something at home than to stay idle, so I bought a basic course of python.
I once thought the "little tadpoles" I didn't know would never know me, but during that time I learned it with great interest.
Eating, going to the toilet, on the subway, walking, I was either thinking or watching,
some problems that couldn't be solved sometimes were implemented in dreams, I quickly wrote them down in the morning.

Gradually, I found that python had many shortcomings: low performance, troublesome deployment, varied paradigms,
so I immediately learned docker, golang, typescript, react, svelte, vue...

Speaking of "10,000-hour rule", "as long as you work hard", "nothing is impossible", and so on...
My own feeling is: if you want to do something but have no interest in it, you must first cultivate interest in it,
and then let interest become the best teacher.

## Entrepreneur

In the past two years, AI has developed very rapidly, and rumors say that Gates said that any existing software is worth using AI to rebuild,
plus DeepSeek entering the domestic software ecosystem, the AI era has begun.

In May 2025, I wanted to try building my own product, so I registered a UK company, opened Stripe,
I used sveltekit to build a full-stack project at first, but later found that the sveltekit ecosystem was too small,
so I had to turn to nextjs, but nextjs was very bulky, and there were a lot of things to learn, so I built my own template project.

As a developer, being able to build doesn't mean being able to market, but as a product manager, I have been more focused on systems and requirements in my past work,
so I have no experience in growth, this is my urgent shortcoming.

## Conclusion

You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
